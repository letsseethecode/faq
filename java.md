# Java

I've done very little Java, and that doesn't make me sad.  I remember when it was first introduced, as I was in University at the time and there was a lot of interest in it.  Later in my career, when I saw the writing on the wall for [Delphi](./delphi.md) I decided I needed to jump ship to either Java or [C#](./csharp.md), so I created the same project in both languages.  C# won hands down, and I never looked back.

## Pros

1. First truly cross-platform language
1. Loved the introduction of abstractions
1. Great language for Domain Modelling

## Cons

1. Poor performance
1. Got stuck in legal battles that hobbled it.
1. Abstractions were over-used and `FactoryServiceManager` classes just became a meme, to the point where I can tell if a developer on a different project was previously a Java dev.

## TL;DR

Do not recommend.

It promised a lot, but didn't deliver for me.  I found it slow and the IDEs were painful to use, so I didn't go back to it.
