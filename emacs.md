# EMACS

I've been wanting to use a terminal based editor for a long time now.  Probably just wanting to claim some nerd cred, but seriously I just found that when streaming it meant that I could focus on a single window without needing to constantly switch back and forth bewtween scenes, which is a pain.

## Pros

1. Widely used
1. Available when I ssh into machines

## Cons

1. Having to unlearn vi/vim
1. Commands are a bit odd at first e.g. Ctrl-X, Ctrl-S to save.  But just need to retrain myself.
