# Delphi (Object Pascal)

When I left university in 1998 Delphi was competing with Visual Basic, and even though VB was more widely used Delphi was far superior.  A bit of a VHS/Betamax situation, probably.  Object Pascal is a great language, and extension of Pascal, which was the first language I was formally taught.

Borland (the makers of Delphi) lost their way, and Microsoft hoovered up their major talent when making C#, and it never really recovered.

## TL;DR

For it's time it was fantastic, but I wouldn't dream of using it now.

Rating: ★★★★☆ (for it's time)
