16" Apple Macbook Pro M1

I love it.  I was late to the Apply band-wagon, and I've now had three  (2015 MBP yay!, 2018 MBP boo! and M1 MBP whoop!).

I hadn't realised just how bad MS windows was until I started using a Mac.  I'd much rather use Linux than Windows given the choice, but there's room for all three IMO.

## TL;DR

Love it, but pricey.
