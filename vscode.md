# Visual Studio Code

This has been my editor for choice for a long time, but I'm using streaming as a chance to teach myself [emacs](./emacs.md).  I will probably switch over to VS Code for various things, because it's still easier for me to use at the present.

## Pros

1. Free
1. Lightweight
1. Lots of supported extensions
1. Cross platform
