# Python

I've spent the last few years using Python and it's proven to be a bit of a love/hate relationship.  It's a fantastic language, but I've seen some nasty things done with it and the tooling leaves something to be desired.

## TL;DR

Great language, but it be easily abused, and the tooling around it feels out-dated.
