# C#

Microsoft's response to [Delphi](./delphi.md) and [Java](./java.md) was the staple of my career for the longest time, and I've still got a lot of time for it.  Microsoft, being in full control of the language, were able to move it forward in ways that both Delphi and Java were unable to.  It was a joy to code in, but being tied to the Windows O/S was it's key flaw.  Microsoft started to address that, but hadn't done so by the time that I stopped using it.

Organisations that use C# tend to be amongst those that still follow the Enterprise Software model that was dominant in the 90's, and are more likely to use Azure as their cloud platform of choice and MS SQL server for persistent, I've found.  They're all in on MS tech, to the detriment of their solutions.

## TL;DR

Excellent language, but it's falling out of favour now, which is unfair.
